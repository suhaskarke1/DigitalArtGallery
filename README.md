Website Requirements
The hypothetical Digital Art Gallery, assumed to be situated in Varanasi, is a gathering room where both pilgrims and inhabitants, tourists and travelers may enjoy a new dimension of sharing ideas. To expand its reach and more people and artists can have access to this amazing gallery, I am building this web app as an online platform. People can have a look at the artworks displayed in the art gallery and can even buy it. Artists, who are not so renowned and need a platform to sell or exhibit their creations, can do so with the help of this Art Gallery. People can get some valuable insights about the art and can learn from some talented artists through the workshops conducted by this art gallery. They can also keep a track about the upcoming exhibitions to be held at the art gallery to visit there. Moreover, this website would help to the art gallery in the pandemic situation where people are unable to step out of their homes.

Functionalities
There are three types of users: admin (already registered and assigned the admin authority), artist and user. Each have some special functions and authorities based on their user type
Artworks are currently categorized in three types and displayed in their respective category page
Users, who are willing to buy any artwork or painting need to log in, and can place an order for that particular piece of art via filling some details like address and email. After placing an order, an email will be sent to them for order confirmation and further proceedings.
Users or Artists, who want to attend any Workshop or Exhibition can check out the respective information on the website and can register themselves. A confirmation mail will be sent to them as well.
Artists who want to sell their artworks need to register themselves under artistâ€™s section. After successful log in, they can submit their artwork details via a form along with their expected price. If the admin approves that artwork, their artwork would be displayed in the Art gallery.
A registered user can also organise a workshop either online/offline by filling up a form available on the web app.
Any artwork has 3 types of tags: Verifying(till the time it is under review period), Unsold(when approved and displayed in the gallery) and Sold(will then be no longer displayed on the web app). There is also a like button to appreciate the artwork.
Admin has two special authorities for now: Accept or Decline the submitted artwork, and to post an Exhibition details.
Beyond this, there were some more features I desire to add, and may add soon in future.
